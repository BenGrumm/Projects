This is an android app written in java for keeping track of tasks and recording thoughts.

It uses recycler views to hold your notes. You can select a group of notes to complete/delete at once, but if you selecetd one you didnt mean to you can undo the complete/delete and the tasks will return to the positions they were in before you deleted them.

View the tasks you have completed in the completed section and then delete them permanantly.
